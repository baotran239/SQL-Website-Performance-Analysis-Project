# [SQL] Website Performance Analysis Project

## I. Introduction
This project leverages Google BigQuery to analyze customer purchase behavior on an e-commerce platform. By applying advanced SQL techniques such as CTEs, Aggregate Functions, and Table Functions, it processes key metrics like page views, transactions, and bounce rates, etc. to uncover trends and insights. The findings help businesses optimize strategies, enhance user experience, and drive conversions through data-driven decisions.

## II. Dataset
This is a dataset available on Google BigQuery named "ga_session". To access the dataset, follow these steps:
- Log in to your Google Cloud Platform account and create a new project.
- Navigate to the BigQuery console and select your newly created project.
- In the navigation panel, select "Add Data" and then "Search a project".

## III. Analysis
### **Query 01: Calculate total visit, pageview, transaction for Jan, Feb and March 2017 (order by month)**
```sql
SELECT
 EXTRACT(month FROM PARSE_DATE('%Y%m%d', date)) AS month,
 SUM(totals.visits) AS visits,
 SUM(totals.pageviews) AS pageviews,
 SUM(totals.transactions) AS transactions 
FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_2017*`
WHERE _table_suffix BETWEEN '0101' AND '0331'
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month;
```
| month  | visits | pageviews | transactions |
|--------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| 201701 | 64694  | 257708    | 713         |
| 201702 | 62192  | 233373    | 733         |
| 201703 | 69931  | 259522    | 993         |

The data from Q1 2017 shows relatively stable website traffic, with visits and pageviews maintaining a consistent trend across January, February, and March. However, March stands out with a notable increase in transactions (993) compared to the previous months (713 in January and 733 in February).

### **Query 02: Bounce rate per traffic source in July 2017 (Bounce_rate = num_bounce/total_visit) (order by total_visit DESC)**
```sql
SELECT
 trafficSource.source,
 SUM(totals.visits) AS total_visits,  
 SUM(totals.bounces) AS total_no_of_bounces,
 SUM(totals.bounces)/SUM(totals.visits)*100 AS bounce_rate
FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201707*`
GROUP BY trafficSource.source
ORDER BY total_visits DESC;
```
| Row | source                 | total_visits | total_no_of_bounces | bounce_rate |
|-----|------------------------|-------------|----------------------|----------------|

- The add-to-cart rate shows a steady increase from 28.47% in January 2017 to 37.29% in March 2017, indicating an improvement in customer interest in purchasing products.
- The purchase rate also rises from 8.31% to 12.64%, suggesting better conversion efficiency.
- The highest engagement and purchase activity are observed in March 2017, showing an increasing trend in customer purchasing behavior over time.

## IV. Conclusions
The analysis reveals stable traffic with a rise in transactions by March 2017. Direct traffic drives the highest revenue, while bounce rates vary across sources. Purchasers have fewer pageviews per session, indicating efficient navigation. Conversion rates from product views to purchases steadily improve, and cross-selling opportunities emerge from frequently co-purchased items. These insights help optimize marketing, user experience, and conversion strategies to drive growth.
